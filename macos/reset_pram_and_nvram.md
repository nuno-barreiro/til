**PRAM**, which stands for Parameter Random Access Memory, is a type of memory used in some Mac computers that stores key system settings and preferences, such as time and date, volume, and startup disk selection.
In some newer Macs, PRAM has been replaced by **NVRAM** (Non-Volatile Random Access Memory), which also stores system settings and preferences. 
NVRAM does not require a battery to retain its data, but it may occasionally need to be reset to resolve issues related to booting or network connectivity.

Resetting NVRAM and PRAM it's a simple process:

1. Shut down your Mac.
2. Press the power button to turn on your Mac.
3. Immediately press and hold the following keys on your keyboard: Option, Command, P, and R.
4. Hold these keys down until you hear the startup sound twice or see the Apple logo appear and disappear twice.
5. Release the keys and let your Mac continue to start up as usual.

This can solve some issues such as:

- Incorrect display resolution
- Unexpected volume or sound behavior
- Incorrect date, time, or time zone data
- Erratic mouse scrolling and clicking behavior
- Unusual keyboard responses
